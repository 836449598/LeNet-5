## LeNet-5 ##
  This is a implement of LeNet-5 which is one of the most famous CNN (convolution nerual network).
  
# WHY # 
  Deep learning is so popular that everyone who want a further study should understand it deeply.
But I don't satisfy to use the open-source framework. I hope to understand cardinal principle of CNN.
  Therefore, I read the classical paper and programmed the LeNet-5 by Matlab.
  
# Functions #
  **LeNet5** is the core of the algorithm. This forword process is very clear and easy understand. 
But the number of every layer should be more think.

  **backPropagation** is another important part of the algorithm. The backward process can be understand by derviation.
But the implement is not so easy. I spent much time on this part.

## conculsion ##
  From this practice, I understand the CNN more deeply. I think reconstruct the famous network will be more useful.
